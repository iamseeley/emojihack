# 🛠️ Emoji Hack

Hi there, I'm Thomas. I started Emoji Hack as a challenge to create a software or web dev project for every single emoji.

I wanted to make lots of different things and keep track of them in a fun way, so I thought, why not use emojis? Emojis are fun right?

So, for every project there is an associated emoji. Sometimes an idea comes first, and then an emoji is chosen for it; other times, the emoji itself inspires the project.

I'm going to try to keep the max time I spend on individual projects to one week, but will go longer depending on interest.
