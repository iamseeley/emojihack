# 🛠️ Emoji Hack

Hi there, I'm Thomas. I started Emoji Hack as a challenge to create a software or web dev project for every single emoji.

I wanted to make lots of different things and keep track of them in a fun way, so I thought, why not use emojis? Emojis are fun right?



### If you would like to participate in the Emoji Hack challenge as well, follow the steps in [setup](#setup), and join the [discord](https://discord.gg/6yNYj4mD9C)!


## Setup

```
git clone git@github.com:iamseeley/emojihack.git
cd emojihack
npm install

```

Once you have everything setup fill in your own information in emojihack.json, and please remove all my projects by running ```npm run setup```.
