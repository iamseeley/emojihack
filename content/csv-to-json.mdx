When I started Emoji Hack one of the first things I needed was a good emoji dataset.

I ended up going with [Full Emoji Dataset]('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subinium/emojiimage-dataset') I found on Kaggle.

The only download option was a csv file and I wanted a json file. Project opportunity!

I wrote a simple script in Python that converts the csv file to json. 

The data needed to be cleaned up a little. So, I removed some fields and changed one I wanted to use as an identifier.
